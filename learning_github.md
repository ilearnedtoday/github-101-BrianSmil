# I have come to learn that Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in your code, 
# aswell as enabling collaboration and sharing of code with fellow developers. on the other hand Github is a platform
# that allows developers to collaborate on project easily, without the risk of losing previous work. in a nutshell
# Github is like a library where you store books while git is like writin a book that you'll take to the library(Github)
# for people to read (Projects).
# TERMS I'VE LEARNED
# REPOSITORY - A repository is like a folder where your projects happens, or where your projects are stored.
# Cloning - Cloniing is like creating a local copy of your repository on your local computer
# Commiting and Sharing - This is basically adding the changes you made on your local computer to your remote repository on github
